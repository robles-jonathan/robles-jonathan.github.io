        <h1>Playstation 5</h1>
        <p>
            The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020 in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, Singapore and South Korea. Worldwide released followed a week later. The PlayStation 5 along with Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, released the same month, are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The platform was launched in two variants: a base model with an Ultra HD Blu-ray-compatible optical disc drive, and a Digital Edition lacking this drive, serving as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PlayStation 5's main features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects, and backward compatibility with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.

                    Games have hubs on PS5. Each game’s hub collects everything related to that game together, from activities, to community broadcasts, to new game content. It’s a constantly updated space that will evolve and adapt throughout the game’s lifecycle.
